# Explanations
The user is greeted with a login page where they have the option to sign in to their account. If the user doesn't have an account, they can proceed to the next page. After filling in their information to create an account, they can access the main page where they can manage their tasks.

To add a task, simply enter its description in the first field. You can also include additional details such as a task description and its due date. On the right side of the page, you can track your progress by viewing the percentage of completed tasks out of the total. Tasks can also be sorted by their due dates.

Tasks can be deleted by clicking the red "X" button and marked as "completed" by clicking the green button. As you complete tasks, your progress will be reflected in real-time. Finally, you have the option to sort tasks by their due dates, and you can also log out.
